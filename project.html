            <p>Road assessment and repair is a complicated business involving interactions between city residents, public works departments (PWDs), and private contractors. We couldnâ€™t possibly address all the problems in this space, so we decided to focus solely on road quality assessment. If our system could accurately assess road quality and relay that information, PWDs could devote their time and resources into fixing bad roads instead of identifying them.</p>
		 <p>The importance of the road infrastructure for the society could be compared with importance of blood vessels for humans. To ensure road surface quality it should be monitored continuously and repaired as necessary. The optimal distribution of resources for road repairs is possible providing the availability of comprehensive and objective real time data about the state of the roads.  Participatory sensing is a promising approach for such data collection.</p>
